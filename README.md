myWeather is a simple Python library that allows you to retrieve weather data for any location in the world.

## Installation

weather_data = myWeather.get_weather('Seattle, WA')

print(f"The current temperature in Seattle is {weather_data['temperature']}Â°F with {weather_data['description']} conditions.")
```
